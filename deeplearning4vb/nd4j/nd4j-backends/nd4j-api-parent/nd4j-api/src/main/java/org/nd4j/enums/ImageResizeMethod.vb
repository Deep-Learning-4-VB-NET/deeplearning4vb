	''' <summary>
	''' ResizeBilinear: Bilinear interpolation. If 'antialias' is true, becomes a hat/tent filter function with radius 1 when downsampling.
	''' ResizeLanczos5: Lanczos kernel with radius 5. Very-high-quality filter but may have stronger ringing.
	''' ResizeBicubic: Cubic interpolant of Keys. Equivalent to Catmull-Rom kernel. Reasonably good quality and faster than Lanczos3Kernel, particularly when upsampling.
	''' ResizeGaussian: Gaussian kernel with radius 3, sigma = 1.5 / 3.0.
	''' ResizeNearest: Nearest neighbor interpolation. 'antialias' has no effect when used with nearest neighbor interpolation.
	''' ResizeArea: Anti-aliased resampling with area interpolation. 'antialias' has no effect when used with area interpolation; it always anti-aliases.
	''' ResizeMitchelcubic: Mitchell-Netravali Cubic non-interpolating filter. For synthetic images (especially those lacking proper prefiltering), less ringing than Keys cubic kernel but less sharp.
